Hastings Digital is a website design and development agency providing a broad range of digital services to small and medium sized businesses and individuals in Hastings and the surrounding areas.

We're a small team which means we can work one to one with you ensuring that we deliver exactly what you need. We like to keep things as simple as possible which means a focus on what matters to you. Our work is precise, clean, clear and fast which is a key consideration in todays multi device world.  

Whether you already have an established website which needs enhancing or whether you're looking to build a new website from scratch then we can help.

### Value for money

Our websites typically start from around Â£525 which includes everything you need to get up and running.

Typically includes the website itself, a Content Management System (CMS) so that you can update the site yourself, a personalised email address and hosting on a reliable and secure web server.

We provide a range of additional services such as [Search Engine Optimisation](http://hastings.digital/serices)  which we offer either on a daily or hourly rate.

### Bespoke

We don't use a 'cookie cutter' approach to our sites where your site looks the same as the last one we produced. All our site are designed and built from the ground up using the most up to date techniques. If you already have an existing brand identity we will use that as a basis for a new design so that your brand reputation is carried forward.
