Introduction
------------

The following proposal is for the migration and management of the Hastings Beer and Music Festival site including online ticket sales.

The proposal is to move the ticket sales to a third party service, implement a new mobile optimised website along with a new design and improved content layout.

### Website

In the absence of a detailed requirements document for the website I'm making a few assumptions about what is required and how that can best be achieved.  

It's apparent that the current website falls short in a number of areas.

- It's difficult to update
- It's not optimised for mobile
- The information is not presented in a clear and logical fashion
- The design is a little dated

Given that there is a relatively short space of time to complete the work I have opted for a solution that 'out sources' the ticket sales aspect of the site to a third party while keeping the content management within a standard CMS such as Joomla!

Broadly there are two main elements to the site.

#### Ticket sales

As mentioned I'm proposing a third party service to handle the ticket sales for HBMF.

The service I've been looking at is called Shopify (https://shopify.co.uk).

Essentially Shopify is a service which allows you to create product items which you can offer for sale via an existing website. The easiest way to achieve this using the service is via a widget which once embedded on a page instantly adds full shopping cart functionality.

I've mocked up a simple page with a shopify button to demonstrate how this looks.

This is just a mock up but I could see this working in a very similar fashion on the HBMF wesbsite.

When the 'add to cart' button is clicked the product is added to a cart where the quantity can be amended and then the user is taken through a traditional checkout process.

All of the key aspects of the cart and checkout process are customisable.

By using this third party service for the ticket sales the scope of the work becomes much smaller. In effect we're then looking at a reasonably straightforward migration/re-design. This is useful for two reasons.

Firstly, by keeping the scope of the work to a minimum the work can be completed for a much smaller up front cost.

Secondly, a smaller amount of work means it should achievable in a shorter space of time. Given the reasonably tight deadline for this project - I'm assuming that the site needs to be up and selling ticket by early April - this can only be a good thing.

There are also other advantages. For example:

- Possible to sell tickets via a Facebook 'app'
- Embed a 'buy tickets now' button into an email and broadcast to a mailing list
- Slick and easy checkout process
- Optimised for mobile devices
- Manage postage charges
- VAT is automatically calculated
- Integrated PayPal option
- No need for HTTPS certificates

The possible disadvantage of this option is that there is commission on any sales made via Shopify, although I assume that will be true of most payment gateways.

#### HBMF Website

The other aspect is, of course, the main public facing website.

It's likely that the amount of work involved in retaining the existing WordPress site (i.e.upgrading, optimising, building out a new template and navigation scheme) outweighs that involved by simply  migrating the content onto a new simpler platform (e.g. Joomla!).

Therefore, I recommend migrating the site. Care would be taken in order to perform the migration in accordance with Google best practices to ensure a seamless migration.

##### Navigation and layout

I suggest implementing a navigation scheme along similar line to other festival sites. For example

- http://www.leefest.org/home/
- http://endoftheroadfestival.com/

So I would propose a top-level navigation as follows:

- Home
- Lineup
- Beer
- Info
- Tickets
- News

The key calls to action (e.g. buy tickets) will be highlighted in an accent colour to draw the attention of the user.

The 'info' section would contain links through to more details pages about the roots of the festival, the organisers, location and travel details etc. For example:

- Info
  - History
  - Round table / organisers
    - Links to round table website
  - Location and map
  - Site info
  - Sponsors
  - etc

Having this clear navigation would allow a focus on imagery and testimonials as well as social media.

Once the navigation is agreed I will provide static wireframes of suggested layouts.

##### Design

Once the wireframe layouts have been agreed I would work closely with the Round table to deliver a clean, modern site.

This would involve an element of graphic design prior to any coding.
I would seek to work with a local creative / graphic designer to provide a re-freshed and re-invigorated look and feel for the HBMF website.
