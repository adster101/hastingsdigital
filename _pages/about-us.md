Hastings Digital are a small independent web design and development consultancy based in the small seaside town of Hastings on the south coast of Sussex.

We pride ourselves on being able to serve both small local businesses as well as providing bespoke development work for larger agencies and organisations that require more than a simple website. 

## What we offer
So what do we do?  Quite simply we design, develop and build fantastic websites  that don't cost a fortune. 

**Starting from Â£425** our pricing includes all you need to get a website up and running including hosting and email. 

We also provide custom development solutions should you require something more than a straightforward contact us form. 

We are specialists in Content Management Systems such as **Joomla!** and **Expression Engine**. Recently we've also been working with static site generators such as Jekyll.

## Digital marketing
We also undertake Search Engine Optimisation, copy writing as well as being able to manage your social media profile. PPC advertising via Google Adwords is also something we can offer.

## Data driven
If you already have a website the chances are you already have a wealth of data such as the number of visitors to your site. Using this data we can provide Conversion Rate Optimisation (CRO) for the key goals of your website. Using this data driven approach we can propose changes to your website based on real data rather than guesswork.
