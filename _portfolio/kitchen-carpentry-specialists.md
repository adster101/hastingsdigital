When we were approached by Ross to build a new website for his company KCS there were two key aspects of the brief.

Firstly, the site needed to look clean and modern with a minimimalist feel. It seems as though that is the trend for a lot of kitchens these days and it's no bad thing for a website either.

Secondly, the site needed to act as a showcase of projects that KCS had completed so that prospective clients could see in advance the high quality finish that Ross and his team deliver.

With the above in mind we set about mocking up the site and getting the layout down.

This is one of the first sites where we've used the full width of the screen on larger monitors and while this felt a bit awkward at first the additional space in which to let the content 'breathe' helped to create the minimal and sleek feel Ross was after.  

We created a 'portfolio' section listing all the recent projects in reverse date order. Clicking through to each project shows a brief description of the work along with a comprehensive series of before and after photos which really gives a feel for the work that was completed and shows off the high quality finish.

To further promote the portfolio we also added a 'recent projects' area which appears on all pages of the site. This area highlights four recent projects at random further promoting the portfolio throughout the site.

In addition, we also added a 'Quick quote' form to all pages to allow potential customers to quickly and easily get in touch with Ross and his team.

We also helped Ross design a sleek new logo which could be used across the web as well as business cards and letterheads and so on.

Lastly, we built the site out using the Joomla CMS so that all content is easily managed and updated.
