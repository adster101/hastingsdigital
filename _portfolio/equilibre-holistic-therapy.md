The previous Equilibre site was in need of a makeover. The old site design had worked well but the template wasn't responsive so anyone viewing the site on a smartphone or tablet were getting a sub-par user experience. The backend CMS used to manage the site content was also badly out of date and also needed upgrading.

First things first, we focused on updating the old Joomla 1.5 installation. We came across a Joomla component specifically designed to ease the migration of old 1.5 site which greatly speeded up the migration process. All in all the site was migrated to a shiny new Joomla 3 install within a day.

The next thing was to update the template so that the site worked correctly across all mobile devices and tablets. While we were at it we also took the opportunity to re-focus the homepage so that the emphasis was on the treatments that Patricia at Equilibre offers.

The result is a site that is now usable on any device large or small and is powered by a CMS which is easy to keep up to date and manage.

### Scope of work:
  - Responsive design
  - CMS migration
