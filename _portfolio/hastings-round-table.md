The Hastings division of the Round Table are one of the busiest tables in the country organising the popular Hasting Beer and Music festival every year.

The brief was simple. The site needed to reflect the charitable activities as well as promoting the Round Table in a positive and welcoming manner in an effort to encourage new members.

Working closely with the round table members James and Peter we created a clean, modern website which does exactly what it needs to do. The site was initally mocked up via static wireframes and modified until the Round Table were happy with the design and look of the site.

The site design was then easily incorportated into a Joomla template and the site built out with content and images.

The result is a focused site highlighting the activities and charitable deeds of the Round Table along with an online form to encourage more funding requests.
